# 🏎️ Elite Automation Suite

[![Persian](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-Persian-green.svg?style=for-the-badge)](AUTOMATION-FA.md)

This document details the total automation ecosystem of the **SnappBox Elite** project. Our goal is to eliminate human error and elevate development velocity to elite standards.

---

## 🛰️ 1. API Sentinel (Autonomous Evolution)
The Sentinel autonomously monitors the official SnappBox API documentation (`snapp-box.com/api-doc`) in real-time.
- **Autonomous Detection**: If new endpoints (e.g., Tracking) are added, the system immediately recognizes the changes.
- **Automated Code Generation**: The engine generates the required PHP Service classes and implementation logic without manual intervention.
- **Zero-Touch Integration**: New services are automatically registered in the DI container and made available for immediate use.

## 🛠️ 2. Autonomous Debugging & Self-Healing
Using the `/debug` command, the elite engine performs the following:
- **Log Scanning**: Analyzes PHP and WooCommerce logs to identify hidden exceptions.
- **API Health Triggers**: Executes comprehensive connectivity tests via the HealthCheck service.
- **Static Analysis (PHPStan)**: Verifies code precision at Level 6.
- **Self-Healing**: If high-confidence issues are identified, the system automatically applies and verifies fixes.

## 🛡️ 3. Elite Security & Performance Audit
The `/audit` command is responsible for maintaining the project's premium standards:
- **Security Guard**: Verifies nonces, capability checks, and data sanitization across all endpoints.
- **Caching Layer**: Identifies expensive API calls and automatically wraps them in a transient-based caching layer for lightning-fast performance.
- **Compliance**: Ensures 100% adherence to WordPress Coding Standards (WPCS).

## 🏗️ 4. Elite Factory (Boilerplate Automation)
The `/factory` and `/add-feature` commands are designed for rapid, standardized extension:
- **Standardized Architecture**: Rapidly generates classes with modern namespacing and PSR-4 structures.
- **Dynamic UI Registration**: Automatically updates the data-driven Admin Panel and Setup Wizard without the need for manual code modification.

## 🏎️ 5. Deployment Orchestrator
The `/push` command automates the entire production lifecycle:
- **Vite Integration**: High-speed asset building for React and Tailwind CSS v4.
- **Autoload Optimization**: Optimizes the composer class map for maximum load speed.
- **Synchronized Release**: Publishes a new production version to GitHub with automated changelogs.
